# ANNOYING OS

## What has been implemented so far?

### Visually
- Windows 11 default background
- taskbar
	- start button
	- search input line
	- more buttons (e.g. file explorer)
	- date and time
- desktop files:
	- recycle bin
	- spotify
	- files
- basic window layout
- color swap shader
### Functionally
- right click = context menu
- taskbar buttons are highlighted when hovering
- window:
	- closes with click on x button
	- turns on gravity for cursor
- game master:
	- left click counter
	- 10 last keys pressed added to a list
- desktop file icon detects left click
- left click & drag on desktop draws a selection rectangle
- left click on search icon = zoom to random zoom state
	- if zoom is more than 100%, screen can be scrolled by moving the cursor to the edge

## What is being worked on? Current problems and issues?
- making the screen scroll better
- making the selection shape weirder

## What are we planning to implement?
- sooo many things

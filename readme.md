# ANNOYING OS

## Description

*"Windows POS" is a virtual desktop application that reacts to user input in unexpected ways and thus calls into question the usersâ€™ assumptions and preconceptions about interactive interfaces. It is designed to be frustrating and opposite to what UI designers might call intuitive. Upon first glance, it may appear as a regular Windows 11 desktop surface, but while interacting with the application the user will experience how much of what they take for granted in a digital user interface is the result of a decade-long process of standardization, influenced and driven by the capitalist system. This project is a commentary on the illusion of control in digital spaces, and on the ways in which digital architecture and design under capitalism are built around the ideal worker default in order to increase productivity, leaving behind those who may not fit this narrow definition: disabled people, homeless people, people who never had the means to learn the conventions of digital user interfaces, and more. Modern digital spaces were not made for them, and "Windows POS" was not made for you.*

## What has been implemented so far?

### Visually
- Windows 11 default background
- taskbar
	- start button
	- search input line
	- more buttons (e.g. file explorer)
	- date and time
- desktop files:
	- recycle bin
	- "myFace"
	- files
- basic window layout
- color swap shader
### Functionally
- twice an hour a cuckoo clock sound will play
- right click on taskbar, wallpaper or icon = context menu
- taskbar buttons & icons are highlighted when hovering
- window:
	- closes with click on x button
	- moves with clicking left & right arrows
	- navigation through folders with mouse left click
- game master:
	- left click counter
	- 10 last keys pressed added to a list
- desktop icons detect left clicks and Game Master counts them
- left click & drag on desktop draws a selection rectangle
	- selection rectangle turns into a bubble that floats to the top of the screen
	- it can wrap around desktop icons and will then activate them
- left click on search icon = zoom to random zoom state
	- if zoom is more than 100%, screen can be scrolled by moving the cursor to the edge
- input into search bar & submit will spawn a popup
- if gamemaster list has the letters "c", "l", "i", "c", "k", hover over a taskbar button and press a key to activate it
